## Variable in JS
*** 
1. We use a variable to store data temporarily in computers memory.
2. We store that data in memory and give it a name => variable name
3. Using this name we can read the data in the future.
4. Before ES6, **var** keyword was used to declare a variable. 
5. After ES6, best practice is to use **let** keyword to declare a variable.
