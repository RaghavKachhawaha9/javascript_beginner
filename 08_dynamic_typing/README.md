## Dynamic type vs Static type 
***
* Javascript is a **Dynamic typed language**.

* In Static typed language, the type of variable cannot be changed in future.
* In Dynamically typed language, type of variable can change at runtime.

Eg 1: In javascript we have typeof operator with that we can check type of variable.  
* In console we will first check the type of variable name. Then we will reassign the variable with a number. We will see that the type is changed to a number.

**Note:** typeof is reserved keyword so we cant assign it as a variable name.

Eg 2: If we reassign age as a floating point number. The typeof variable will be same as "number".  
* So in javascript we dont have other types of number like float,int all numbers are of type number.

Eg 3: variable selectColor is of type **object**.
* Console:

**NOTE**: let firstName = undefined; here undefined is also a type and also act as a value.
